Graphs
A* tree search. Search the optimal path between two nodes on a graph. Special case of best-first search that uses heuristics to improve speed.
3D Surface Tracker Technology. Process to add images on walls in a video while hidden surfaces are taken into account.
Bellman-Ford. Computes shortest paths in a weighted graph (where some of the edge weights may be negative).
Graph canonization. Find a canonical form of a graph that is isomorphic to another graph. Used in cheminformatics.
Dijkstra's algorithm. Computes shortest paths in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
Perturbation methods. An algorithm that computes a locally shortest paths in a graph.
Floyd-Warshall. Solves the all pairs shortest path problem in a weighted, directed graph.
Floyd's cycle-finding. Finds cycles in iterations.
Johnson. All pairs shortest path algorithm in sparse weighted directed graph.
Hopcroft–Karp algorithm. From a bipartite graph, returns the maximum number of edges with no common endpoints. Alternatives are  breadth-first and depth-first algos.
Kruskal. Finds a minimum spanning tree for a graph.
Prim's. Finds a minimum spanning tree for a graph. Also called DJP , Jarník or Prim–Jarník algorithm.
Boruvka. Finds a minimum spanning tree for a graph.
Ford-Fulkerson. Computes the maximum flow in a graph.
Edmonds-Karp. Implementation of Ford-Fulkerson.
Nonblocking Minimal Spanning Switch. For a telephone exchange.
Woodhouse-Sharp. Finds a minimum spanning tree for a graph.
Spring based. Algorithm for graph drawing.
Hungarian. Algorithm for finding a perfect matching.
Coloring algorithm. Graph coloring algorithm.
Nearest neighbour. Find nearest neighbour.
Topological sort. Sort a directed acyclic graph in such a manner that each node comes before all nodes to which it has edges (according to directions).
Tarjan's off-line least common ancestors algorithm. Compute lowest common ancestors for pairs of nodes in a tree.
